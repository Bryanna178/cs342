project 3 folder is stuff from what we had from project 4 with some slight modifications that I think will be useful for project 5
- an object is being sent from client to server
- server uses that object's stuff, modifies it and sends it back to the client

**** As of 4/30/19
Project 5 folder has the most updated version of the project with merged code.
- guesses are sent from user to server and server interprets it
- user is notified of a wrong guess with images displayed
- a winner is decided if the word is guessed in full or by parts
